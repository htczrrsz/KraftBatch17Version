Collection


     Data Structures

         Array
         Collection
         Map


     Array:       Size is fixed
                  supports both primitive and non-primitive datatypes
                  supports only one homogeneous type in an array

     Collection:  Size is dynamic
                  supports only non-primitives
                  supports homogeneous --> different types of objects
                  collection is an interface


                  List :      Accept duplicates, preserve put order, has index numbers

                    ArrayList  : dynamic Array
                               : Accessing the data is fast(get())

                    LinkedList : uses doubly linked list( previous nodes reference, data, next nodes reference)
                               : adding/ removing is faster (add(), remove())
                               : requires more memory size

                    Vector     : internally uses array
                               : Thread Safe - synchronised

                    Stack      : last in first out  (LIFO)     (Queue --> fifo)
