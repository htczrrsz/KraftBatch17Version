                  Encapsulation : Hiding data by giving private access modifier
                                  use public getter and setter methods to read/write the data
                                  (kosullarla sinirliyoruz)
                                  TO HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL OF DATA
                                  GETTER: Read only, public instance method (objenin metodu)
                                          Has a return type
                                          Return type is same with the data type of the instance variable
                                          Has no parameter

                                  SETTER: Write only, public instance method
                                          return type is void
                                          Has parameter
                                          Parameter type is same with the data type of the instance variable

getter setter should be public
