1. Primitives          : byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean


2. Type Casting        : implicit, explicit
      a. implicit      : automatic -> casting smaller primitive type to larger    (widening)
      b. explicit      : manuel    -> casting a larger primitive to smaller       (narrowing)


3. Wrapper Class       : The objects that represents the primitives  (primitivelerden obje uretmek icin kullaniyoruz)
                         Enables us to use primitive data types in Collections and Maps
                         Also have useful methods


4. String              : immutable
                         "KraftTech"
                           012345678


              Methods:  length, charAt, trim, toLowerCase, split, replace, substring, equals, equalsIgnoreCase,
                        endsWith, startsWith, toCharArray, indexOf, isEmpty ...


5. StringBuilder    StringBuffer

            mutable char sequences
            have reverse() feature
            slower than string


         StringBuilder  : not synchronised,
                         much faster than StringBuffer

         StringBuffer   : Synchronized


6. Loops                :  repeated actions

                 for    :  if the number of repetition is known
                           for( initialization ; condition ; increment/decrement ){
                                  statements
                           }

                 while  :  to repeat unknown number of times
                           while(condition){
                               statement
                          }

                 branching statements :
                    break     :   exit the loop (switch)
                    continue  :   jumps to the next iteration of the loop
                    return    :   exits the current method



7. Arrays               :  Data Structure supporting multiple variables
                           use when multiple data is needed
                           fast
                           has index
                           supports primitive and nonprimitives
                           can be multidimensional
                           size is fixed, cannot be used with unknown number of data


8. for each Loop        : iteration is fixed ( from first elements to last elements)
                          you don't have access to the index numbers , cannot reassign values
                          data structure is needed to use


9. Custom Methods       : Function
                          reusability
                          series of code fragments for a specific task

                          public static void / anyDataType  methodName (){
                           code perform the task
                          }


10. Method Overloading  :  multiple methods having same name in a class
                           different parameters
                           reusability
                           (Static Polymorphism)
