  Constructor Overloading

  Review:
  Constructor: A special method


  Class Car(){

  String model;

  Syntax: Access-Modifier  (it should be same name =)  ClassName(){       ---> constructor

  }

    use for creating objects;



  this. : to call instance variables, or instance method

  this() : used for calling constructor


  Constructor Call:

1. Constructors cannot be called by its name. We should use --> this() need to be used.
2. Only a constructor can call another constructor
3. Constructor must be called first , should be on the first step
4. One constructor cannot call more than one constructor
5. Constructor cannot call itself
